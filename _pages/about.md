<hr />
Hello! I'm a Postgraduate student at the 
[University of Hyderabad](https://uohyd.ac.in/) 
in the [School of Economics](https://economics.uohyd.ac.in/).
<br />
<br />
My research interests lie at the intersection of gender and labour, focusing on
informal work. I have interned with the Government of Andhra Pradesh twice on schemes which empower self-managed 
and sustainable community based organizations through increasing their access to credit and developing their social capital.
<br />
<br />
Currently, I'm interning at [Sakonsa](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sakonsa/) where I'm collaborating with a team of law and economics students 
to author a data-driven research paper on the impact of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
