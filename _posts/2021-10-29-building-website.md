Every academic [needs](https://theacademicdesigner.com/2019/personal-academic-website-benefits/) a website. Personal websites serve as an extended resume: every facet of your academic pursuits are clearly documented. If you're a junior scholar, having your own page on the internet is even more crucial. Personal pages liberate you from having to depend on your institute. Your website will stay intact even after you shift to a new faculty, and you don't have to deal with the IT department.
<br />
<br />
There are countless free options for building your own website with minimal effort. For example, [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) and [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/). 
However, their ease-of-use is offset by their freemium model. 

## Why I chose GitHub:
I went ahead with GitHub mainly because it is not intrusive like the freemium sites mentioned above. You get a clean looking URL, flexibility and you can brush up your coding skills in the process. In the end, you get a beautiful, minimal and an easy to maintain website, all with minimum effort. 

## Steps:
1. **Create a Github Account:**
    The very first step is to create a GitHub profile (if you don't already have one). When creating, extra attention must be paid to your username, since your
    website's URL will be "yourusername.github.io". 

2. **Adding the Template to your GitHub:** <br />
    The template I've used is [Academic Pages](https://academicpages.github.io/). In GitHub lingo, you have to *fork* the template repo in order to add it to your profile for 
    modification. Go to this [link](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and click on the fork button on the top right. 

3. **Changing the Repo Name** <br />
    After a few minutes, the template will now show up in your account, and the repo will now read "yourusername/academicpages.github.io". To make your website show up, change the
    name of the repo to "yourusername.github.io". After changes are saved, typing "yourusername.github.io" in your address bar will take you to the template hosted in your repo.
